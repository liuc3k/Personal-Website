### __About Me__

Pang-Yu Liu is currently a Data Programmer at [Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC)](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/research/divisions/b/biostatistics) . He received his MS in statistics from [University of Connecticut (UCONN)](https://stat.uconn.edu/) . His work mainly focuses on developing interactive dashboards that provide statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. One of his research projects focuses on creating a dashboard that allows users to visualize the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) dataset from the REDCap system via an API. This dashboard enables users to understand RDCRN data by using statistical graphics such as box-plots, scatter plots, and swimmer plots, etc. In his graduate study, he hopes to develop innovative statistical methods and combine them with Rshiny applications to create reproducible research and communicate statistical results efficiently and intuitively.
